# Agent sleep and wake: rollout

Idle agents nap (VM paused, memory kept) and then hibernate (VM saved to disk,
memory freed). Opening the agent, or any user action on it, wakes it first.
Everything is off by default.

## Switches

All of these must allow it before an agent sleeps:

| Switch | Where | Values |
|---|---|---|
| `HIVRA_SLEEP_MODE` | server env | `off` (default), `observe` (log only), `canary` (only agents with a sleep policy), `on` |
| `proxmox_hosts.sleep_mode` | database, per host | `off` (default), `canary`, `on` |
| `hivra_agents.sleep_policy` | database, per agent | `off` (default), `t1`, `t3`, `full` |
| `hivra_agents.always_on` | database, per agent | `true` means never sleep |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_HIVRA_AGENT_SLEEP` | build env | `1` shows the Asleep status, wake-on-open and the Manage settings |

Optional timing: `HIVRA_SLEEP_NAP_AFTER_SECONDS` (default 300) and
`HIVRA_SLEEP_HIBERNATE_AFTER_SECONDS`.

`NEXT_PUBLIC_` values are built in, so they take effect on the next Git build
of the branch, not when they are saved.

## Turning it on for one host and one agent

```sql
update public.proxmox_hosts set sleep_mode = 'canary', updated_at = now() where id = '<host id>';
update public.hivra_agents set sleep_policy = 'full', always_on = false where id = '<agent id>';
```

Then set `HIVRA_SLEEP_MODE=canary` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_HIVRA_AGENT_SLEEP=1` and
let the branch rebuild. The `sleep-idle-agents` cron runs every minute.

## Checking it

Every sleep and wake writes a row with its timings:

```sql
select at, kind, trigger, from_state, to_state, duration_ms, reason, detail
  from public.hivra_agent_sleep_events
 where agent_id = '<agent id>'
 order by at desc
 limit 20;
```

`detail` breaks the time down by step as `<step>_ms` keys (state read, probe,
suspend, admission, start, resume, fixup), with `script_ms` for the host
script and, for a wake, `total_ms` end to end.

Agents with live chat channels (Telegram, Discord and similar) never sleep in
this version. An agent the idle check cannot read counts as busy.

## Rollback

Set `HIVRA_SLEEP_MODE=off`, or the host's `sleep_mode` to `off`. Nothing new
goes to sleep; sleeping agents still wake when opened. To remove the feature,
wake every sleeping agent first.
